    "* 1. In Section 1.12.1.2, the reader was reminded that the results of a cross- validation are random, due to the random partitioning into training and test sets. Try doing several runs of the linear and k-NN code in that section, comparing results.\n",

Extend the analysis in Section 2.8.5 to the full data set, adding dummy variables indicating the second and third year. Form an approximate 95% confidence interval for the difference between the coefficients of these two dummies.\n",

    "* 3. Suppose we are studying growth patterns in children, at k particular ages. Denote the height of the ith child in our sample data at age j by Hij, with Hi = (Hi1,...,Hik)′ denoting the data for child i. Suppose the population distribution of each Hi is k-variate normal with mean vector μ and covariance matrix Σ. Say we are interested in successive differences in heights,Dij =Hi,j+1−Hij, j=1,2,...,k−1. DefineDi =(Di1,...,Dik)′. Explain why each Di is (k−1)-variate normal, and derive matrix expressions for the mean vector and covariance matrices.\n",
